 # Product Landing Page
 
 Welcome to the Product Landing Page.  The purpose of this project is to provide a product landing page similar
 to https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/RKRbwL.
 
 ## UX
 
 This project is the product landing page of suits, ties and dinner suits.  The information is structured into
 events, demo and descriptions.  The organising principle is interests.
 
 The events section provides details of events where I wore my suits, ties and dinner suits.
 
 The demo section is a video of me wearing a charcoal suit with bottle green tie.  This was before I set off to
 go racing at Wolverhampton on 20 October 2018.
 
 The descriptions section provides a description of my suits, ties and dinner suits.  They have a different background colour.
 
 ### User Stories
 
 My product landing page should have a header element with id=header.
 
 An image must be within the header element.  A logo or photo would make a good image here.
 
 Within the header element there is to be a nav element.
 
 As a user, I want a minimum of 3 clickable elements.
 
 As a user, I want to be taken to the corresponding section of the landing page.
 
 As a user, I can watch an embedded product video.
 
 As a user, I want placeholder text in the email field.
 
 As a user, I want HTML5 Validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address.
 
 Within the form, there is to be a submit input, with corresponding id=submit.
 
 When I click the #submit element the When I click the #submit element, the email is submitted to a static page (use this mock URL: https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit) 
 that confirms the email address was entered and that it posted successfully.
 
 Navbar should be at the top of the viewport.
 
 My product landing page should have at least 1 media query.
 
 My product landing page should utilise CSS Flexbox at least once.
 
 [Wireframes](wireframes/product-landing-page.png) are provided.
 
 ## Features
 
 The navbar is fixed at the top.  There is a video of me wearing a charcoal suit with a bottle green tie.
 
 ## Technologies
 
 This project uses HTML5 to include the iframe tag to use YouTube videos.  Internal CSS3 is provided.
 Bootstrap 4.4.1 is used to facilitate Font Awesome.  Other technologies include fonts.google.com to faciliate
 the use of Font Roboto.  Fallbacks (e.g. Arial, Verdana) are provided.
 
 ## Testing
 
 Go to https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/pen/MJjpwO, select the test suite of Product Landing Page and select Run Tests.
 Make sure all the tests have passed.  If some have failed, go back and edit the code until all tests have passed.
 
 Resize the width of the browser window to see the iframe element responsively resize.  It uses the max-width
 attribute.  Manually check the links to ensure that they are pointing in the correct direction.
